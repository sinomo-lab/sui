# Changelog

All notable changes to SUI are documented in this file. SUI follows Semantic
Versioning, with the usual expectation that the API may change during the
`0.x` series.

## [0.1.0]

Initial public alpha release of the Rust workspace.

### Highlights

- Added a retained-mode application runtime with explicit measure, arrange,
  event, paint, and accessibility passes.
- Added a renderer-neutral scene model and a retained `wgpu` renderer with
  text, image, vector path, clipping, compositing, and color-management
  support.
- Added the built-in widget library, responsive layout primitives, editable
  text controls, data views, overlays, drag and drop, canvas surfaces, and
  Mesh light, dark, high-contrast, OLED, and touch themes.
- Added desktop integration for Linux, macOS, and Windows, plus alpha browser
  support and experimental Android support behind explicit facade features.
- Added deterministic headless testing, semantic locators, screenshot and HDR
  artifact support, AccessKit integration, and an accessibility-tree generated
  terminal UI.
- Added runnable facade examples, the widget-book demo, bundled Lucide icon
  resources, AVIF/HDR helpers, and architecture and API guides.
- Added a language-neutral binding core and source-built native Python and
  Node/Electron bindings with a generated, coverage-checked widget surface.

### Release boundaries

- The Rust API is pre-release and may change before `1.0.0`.
- Browser support is alpha, Android support is experimental, and native HDR
  output is currently strongest on Windows.
- The Python and Node/Electron packages are not part of this registry release;
  their source remains available in the repository for local builds.
- Browser JavaScript bindings, prebuilt Python wheels, prebuilt Node/Electron
  addons, custom WGSL, and zero-copy external-surface composition are not yet
  published or supported release surfaces.
